___
__1. Do you have any prior experience in the field introduced in the introductory session? If so, give a short overview on them.__

Since I was a little kid I started playing and experimenting with computers. At first it was a rather gaming based relation but ended in having fun programming a little.
I often found myself watching over my dad’s shoulders while he typed -back then it was unreadable for me- codes in shell. It fascinated me and I started to do the same just to see where It would take me.
Nowadays I try fixing computers of my friends (removing viruses, making them fool safe) or even building them with a budget they give me. I've also read books about C+, C++ and Java wich lead me to wanting to program even more things. Since then, with Raspberry PI I’m coding little tools and things that help me do things easier or faster in daily life. Also I had a lot of fun scripting and designing websites.
I don’t know if this already makes me a “Hacker”, but I did not start to study to stop here.
___
__2. What expectations or wishes do you have on the data modeling course?__

In this course I wish to get better at coding, getting to know what to type to get the results I’ve looked for and having as much fun as I already have with it. I also want to know what to do with Datasets and get to know what you can do with it.
___
