# Assignment 1

## Exercise 1 

Create a new file in this repository via the web interface. Use [`introduction.md`](introduction.md) as file name.

Inside the file, first enter the following information:

* **Name**: {your name here}
* **E-Mail**: {your smail address here}

Then, answer the following questions:

1. Do you have any prior experience in the field introduced in the introductory session? If so, give a short overview on them.
2. What expectations or wishes do you have on the data modeling course?

Make use of some Markdown formatting like headings and lists when answering these questions, when appropriate.

Below the editor, leave the option "Commit directly to the master branch." checked and click "Commit new file".
