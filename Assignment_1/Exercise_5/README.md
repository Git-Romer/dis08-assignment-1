## Exercise 5

In this exercise, you will be working with the dataset [`lotr_scripts.csv`](lotr_scripts.csv). The original data set can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/lord-of-the-rings-data). 

1. Document the different data fields. (1 point)
2. Identify "dirty" data fields and clean them up. Use regex replace, spreadsheets or whatever you like. Document your working steps in a file `exercise05.md`. Export your data set as a clean CSV file. Add both files to your repository. (5 points)
3. Analyze the data set using shell scripts and/or regex. Document the commands in an additional section in `exercise05.md`. (2 points)
    * Find the total number of lines and unique words used in the dialogs. (0.5p)
    * What is the distribution on the three different films? (0.5p)
    * What are the top 5 characters in the char column? (0.5p)
    * What are the top 5 characters in the dialogs? (0.5p)

Documentation is key! Everything that is **not properly documented** is not verifyable by us and will thus get **0 points**.
