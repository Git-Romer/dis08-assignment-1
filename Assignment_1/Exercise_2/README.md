## Exercise 2 

### [Task 1](Task_1/Task_1.md)
Complete the lessons from the interactive online course at [linuxjourney.com](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell) on learning the command line. Do the quizes in each of the lectures.

Prove your completion with a photo that shows your student ID card and the correct results of the quizes. Make at least 3 photos according to the three digits of your student ID. For example: Your student ID is 1110341 -> Photos of exercises 3, 4, and 1. 

### [Task 2](Task_2/exercise2.md)
Building on exercise 1: Use your new knowledge to count the number of lines in your `introduction.md` file from exercise 1.
Redirect the result to a file, e.g. `lines.txt`.
Print the content of the file to the console.

To submit your solution, copy the commands and their outputs from the shell (including prompt) to a new *markdown-formated file* `exercise2.md`. Make use of the markdown markup for verbatim code blocks to render it nicely in monospace font.

More on markdown-formating can be found at this [markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) from `adam-p` or the official [GitHub Guide to Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
