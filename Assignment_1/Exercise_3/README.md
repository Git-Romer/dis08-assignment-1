## Exercise 3

1. Clone your own repository into your local file system.
2. Play around with the [git visualization tool](https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/) shown in the lecture. Create some commits, branches and tags there and watch the graph grow. (Hint: typing help will show you all the available commands.)
3. Make a screenshot of your work when youâ€™re finished. Save the screenshot on your machine to your working directory (where you cloned your repository into). Give the screenshot a reasonable filename, like `schaer-ex03.png`
4. On the command line:
  * navigate to the directory
  * check your git status
  * add the new file to git
  * and commit the change.
  * Finally, push your changes to the remote repository.
5. Visit your repository on GitHub to verify that your new file is present.
